 To-Do:
 -Merge all three types of trackers on the same tracker by using lua (no idea how haha) -> Maybe in the far away future. Maybe.
 -Get a better picture of Botwoon -> Improved but wrong palette on the head -> DONE
 -Get a better picture of Crocomire -> DONE
 -Maybe make better graphics for the metroid rooms? Works better with 64x images or smaller -> DONE
 -Maybe make a Go Mode toggle? Well, if enough people show interest... -> Uhh probably not. Go Mode is better for games where it isn't clear if you're in go mode or not, but SM has 4 mains conditions.
 -Make the Chozos objective -> DONE
 -Fix the errors that pop up when you start a tracker variation with the Lua items -> DONE
